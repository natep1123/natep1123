### 🪐 Space Travel

**Demo:**

[Watch the demo video here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tfC6vW2x2j1bXtO4CFDQHUlXoQ2jF3DC/view?usp=sharing)

**Summary:**

A React app for managing spacecraft and planets using **Context API** and **React Router**. Users can build, move, and destroy spacecraft, dynamically updating planet populations.

**Features:**

- **Global State Management**: Uses Context API for seamless data sharing across components.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Organized and intuitive routing with React Router, including nested routes and fallback handling.
- **Interactive UI**: Build, move, and destroy spacecraft with real-time updates to planet populations.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API calls to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Loader Component**: Displays a spinner during data fetching for better UX.
- **Reset Functionality**: Option to reset app data to its initial state.

**Why It Stands Out:**

This project deepened my understanding of **state management** and **routing** in React. Implementing the Context API for global state and handling dynamic updates to planet populations was both challenging and rewarding. The app also features a clean, user-friendly interface with smooth transitions and error handling, making it a robust and scalable solution.

**Tech Stack:**

- React.js
- Context API
- React Router
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 & CSS3

### 🔒 [Cipher Encrypt](https://github.com/natep1123/Cipher-Encrypt)

**Demo:**

[Click here to watch the demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ufQQWFktzuHCu78mM49wB1hEYVBSkeKw/view?usp=sharing)

**Summary:**

A custom encryption/decryption tool using a robust letter-shift algorithm, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Features:**

- Sleek, modern UI
- Custom letter-shift algorithm
- Dynamic text animations

### 🎮 [Pong](https://github.com/natep1123/Pong)

**Demo:**

[Click here to watch the demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g_6Vl6GvapNK7SHdZ1wttoHfsBQFVKOP/view?usp=drive_link)

**Summary:**

Classic Pong game built in React.js. (_In progress_)

**Features:**

- Dynamic gameplay & smooth animations
- Clean, polished UI
- Start screen animation, dynamic ball movement, score tracking and "Game Over" screen (currently accessible via "End Game" button)
- Plans to integrate paddles, game logic for user-play, and a database for storing high scores

🏆 **Favorite Project**  
_One of my first React projects, Pong challenged me to refine animations while deepening my understanding of state management. Writing collision logic was surprisingly fun, and seeing the ball’s movement come together furthered my passion for software development. I am eager to return to this project and complete the game logic and integrate the backend sometime post graduation._
